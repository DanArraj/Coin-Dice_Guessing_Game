Coin and dice guessing game project created from prompt: https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/computer-science-independent-project-1-coin-flip/419951

Allows the user to choose whether they want to guess the result of a coin flip or 6 sided dice roll. They make their guess and the program tells the result and whether they were right. It then tells them the total amount of correct and incorrect guesses, and finally asks if they would like to play again.
